# Credit Scoring Model

This project implements a Credit Scoring Model using machine learning techniques. It is designed to predict the creditworthiness of individuals based on historical data.

## Project Structure
- `credit_scoring.py`: Main script for training and evaluating the credit scoring model.
- `train_data.csv`: Training dataset.
- `test_data.csv`: Test dataset.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages.

## Setup
1. **Clone the repository** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd Credit Scoring Model
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. **Prepare your data:**
   - Ensure `train_data.csv` and `test_data.csv` are in the project directory.
2. **Run the model:**
   ```bash
   python credit_scoring.py
   ```
   - The script will train the model on the training data and evaluate it on the test data.

## Requirements
All required packages are listed in `requirements.txt`. Install them using pip as shown above.

## Customization
- You can modify `credit_scoring.py` to change model parameters, features, or evaluation metrics as needed.
- Replace the CSV files with your own datasets, ensuring they follow the expected format.
